The backend passively monitors the GPS and scans for nearby WiFis and mobile cells/towers. From this a database of emitter locations is created.
When UnifiedNlp / microG request a location from Local NLP Backend, a scan for nearby emitter is initiated and a location determined based on the scan results.
Local NLP Backend is a fork of the Déjà Vu NLP Backend with some improvements and some crude UI for configuration and importing / exporting data.

This backend uses no network data.
All data acquired by the phone stays on the phone, though it can be exported manually.
